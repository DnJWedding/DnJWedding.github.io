            <p>
              According to Hinduism there are sixteen religious rites to be preformed by every
              Hindu. These are called <i>sanskaras</i>. Vivah (marriage) is one of these <i>sanskaras</i> according
              to Lord Manu. <i>Vivah</i> is a union with consent between a man and a woman for life and is
              religiously solemnized. It is the ceremony prior to the entry into the householder's 
              life, the second of the fours stafes in the life of a Hindu.

            <p>
              Vivah is a union which binds not only two hearts together, but two families as well.
              In Hinduism this union is especially sacred. For the strength to love, to obey, to
              discriminate, and to understand, humble supplications are made by the dulhan (bride)
              and the dulha (groom) at the time of the Vivah. A married couple living according to
              the dictates of Dharma, pooling their mental and physical resources together for the
              success of the marriage union, can achieve nothing but complete martial bliss.

            <p>
              On the wedding day at an auspicious hour, the dulha, bedecked in resplandent ornamental
              costumes, with a crown on the head and yellow or pink gown, arrive with his family and 
              and friends at the dulhan's residence where the ceremony takes place. This is his Baraat.

              At the entrance to the dulhan's residence, the fathers of both dulhan and dulha embrace each
              other. The dulha is garlanded. Vedic hymms are chanted by the priest in attendance. A short puja
              or prayer service takes place. The dulha accepts a gift from the dulhan's father.

              The dulha enters the premises where the mother of the dulhan and her female friends welcome him.
              They honer him with Aarti, give him gifts and extol his virtues in their songd. Some of them may
              be seeing him for the first time and for this reason Parchan, which means examination, is done.
              They see his face and his physical features.
