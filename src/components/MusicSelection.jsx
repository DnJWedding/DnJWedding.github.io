                <ul>
                  <li>Parental Seating: Across The Stars (Love Theme from Star Wars Episode 2: The Clone Wars) by John Williams</li>
                    <p>
                      The love theme that comes to us from a galaxy far, far away, <i>Across the Stars</i> was chosen for the parental seating 
                      because the Bride and Groom really like Star Wars and love.
                      </p>
                  <li>Bridal Party Processional: The Ring Goes South (From Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring) by Howard Shore</li>
                    <p>
                      The Bride and Groom chose <i>The Ring Goes South</i>, the theme of the Fellowship because it symbolized the journey
                      many of the bridal party has come on with the bride and groom.
                    </p>
                  <li>Bridal Processional: A Thousand Years by The Piano Guys</li>
                    <p>
                    The Bride chose this version of A Thousand Years becuase The Piano Guys were one of two instrumental groups she and the 
                    groom enjoy listening to (The other being Two Cellos).
                    </p>
                  <li>Bride and Groom Recessional: The Throne Room/End Theme (From Star Wars: A New Hope) By John Williams</li>
                    <p>
                    Another song from a galaxy far, far away, The Bride and Groom chose this song for their recessional because it 
                    sybolizes unity and the victory over fate and foe.
                    </p>
              </h2>Reception</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li>Bride and Groom Introduction: Danger Zone by Kenny Loggins</li>
                    <p>
                      In an introduction that will take your breath away, The Bride and Groom are each other's wingman as they walk out as a 
                      married couple for the first time. Hopefully they'll tear themselves from the heaven in each other's eyes long enough to 
                      play with the boys (and girls) at the wedding before they head off to destinations unknown.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Note: The Groom also apologizes for his inability to leave the puns alone.
                    </p>
                  <li>Bride and Groom Dance: Take on Me (Acoustic) by A-ha</li>
                    <p>
                      Take on Me is a classic song that's quirk and eccentricity match the Bride and Groom Perfectly
                      </p>
                  <li>Father-Daughter Dance: Accross The Universe by The Beatles</li>
                    <p>
                      Is this my espresso machine? Wh-what is-h-how did you get my espresso machine? My dad once told me, laugh and the world laughs with you, 
                      Cry, and I'll give you something to cry about you little bastard! Must go faster. This thing comes fully loaded. AM/FM radio, reclining 
                      bucket seats, and... power windows.
                    </p>
                  <li>Mother-Son Dance: ????? </li>
                    <p>
                    A mystery song from childhood, the Groom picked a somewhat unorthodox song to dance with his mother to. However, a couple hints to the 
                    song are that it is from a Shah Rukh Khan movie and the sound track was listened to a lot while the Groom was growing up. Guessing the 
                    song may be a bit of a gamble though....
