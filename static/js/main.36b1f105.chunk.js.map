Under the bedecked atmosphere, the dulha's\n              hand is held by the dulhan's fther and his request is that the relationship between the two parties remain as \"sweet\" as \n              the liquid combination ghee, dhai, and honey, which are the ingredients of Hindu hositality.

The sacrifical fire is kinded by the dulhan's priest and then\n              the rest of the ceremony takes place. The dulhan, now adorned in a richly colored sori, enters the Mandap. In a touching\n              ceremony, the dulhan's hands are placed in the dulha's while water is being poured in a continous flow by the dulhan's brother.\n              The priedt reads the sacred vow which the dulhan's father takes in giving his daughter away. Now, in all solemnity, she is handed\n              to the man whom she loves and will obey henceforth.

The significance of throwing grains is that they both will join together in\n              preforming the Yajnas, sacrifices and religious rites which a Hindu household is required to preform throughout their married life. Moreover\n              the dulhan, by leading first, is demonstrating her determination to stand first beside her husband in all their happiness and sorrows during\n              their married life.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"col-lg-12\">\n            <h3 className=\"font-weight-light\">Sapta Padi</h3>\n            <p>\n              The couple then walks seven steps together recuting mantras which express their principal duties as housholders:\n            </p>\n            <ListGroup variant=\"flush\">\n              <ListGroup.Item>Let us take the first step to provide our household with a nourishing diet.</ListGroup.Item>\n              <ListGroup.Item>Let us take the second step to develop physical, mental, and spiritual powers.</ListGroup.Item>\n              <ListGroup.Item>Let us take the thrid step to acquire and increase our wealth by righteous means and proper use.</ListGroup.Item>\n              <ListGroup.Item>Let us take the fourth step to acquire knowledge, happiness, and harmony by mutual love and trust</ListGroup.Item>\n              <ListGroup.Item>Let us take the fifth step so that we are blessed with strong, virtuous and heroic children.</ListGroup.Item>\n              <ListGroup.Item>Let us take the sixth step for self restaint and longevity.</ListGroup.Item>\n              <ListGroup.Item>Let us take the seventh step to be true and faithful companions and remain lifelong partners by this wedlock.</ListGroup.Item>\n            </ListGroup>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"col-lg-12\">\n            <h3 className=\"font-weight-light\">Shila Rohan</h3>\n            <p>\n              Shila means a rick and Rohan meand to thread on.

From request number one through six, the dulhan seeks to be consulted on all \n              important issues relating to their successful matrimonial life. The final request is that they should be devoted to each other and nothing \n              should come between them. The dulha answers in the affirmative, and he himself makes one request of the dulhan, that in accordance with Dharma,\n              she shall devoted to him mind nd body.

This is the traditional mark of the Hindu married woman whose husband is alive.\n              The dulha requests that she keeps this mark on her head signifying her marriage to him.
